        Ganesha Integration Case Competition (GICC) 2022 is a program that strives to encourage university-level students to innovate and solve real industrial problems GICC will emulate work life in the business industry for undergraduate students by being deployed in the form of a case competition. Due to a general lack of proper knowledge and experience regarding real-world industrial problems and professionalism concepts (ethics and team management competence), GICC aims to help participants collaborate with new colleagues from various backgrounds to mimic innovation generation in true corporate fashion. Hence, GICC will serve as a platform for established companies to put their case studies to be solved by undergraduate students around Indonesia.
